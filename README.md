# Jenkins Terraform Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to set up a Jenkins pipeline for building, testing, and deploying Terraform infrastructure as code (IaC). It provides a structured workflow for managing infrastructure changes in a version-controlled manner.

## Overview

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a best practice for managing and provisioning cloud resources. Jenkins, a popular continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool, can be used to automate the process of creating, testing, and deploying Terraform configurations.

This repository serves as a reference for implementing such a pipeline using Jenkins. It includes a sample Jenkinsfile that defines the pipeline stages for Terraform:

- **Checkout**: Retrieves the Terraform project from a Git repository.
- **Terraform Init**: Initializes Terraform and downloads necessary providers/plugins.
- **Terraform Validate**: Validates the Terraform code for syntax and other issues.
- **Terraform Plan** (Optional): Generates and saves a Terraform execution plan.
- **Terraform Apply**: Applies the Terraform changes to create or update infrastructure.
- **Terraform Destroy (Cleanup)**: Destroys the Terraform resources (optional).

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this pipeline, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Jenkins: Install and configure Jenkins on your server or local environment.

2. Jenkins Plugins: Ensure that you have installed the necessary Jenkins plugins, including the HashiCorp Terraform plugin.

3. Git Repository: Host your Terraform project in a Git repository, e.g., GitHub.

4. AWS/GCP/Azure Credentials: If deploying to a cloud provider, configure the appropriate cloud credentials in Jenkins.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your Jenkins server or local machine.

2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline job and configure it to use the provided Jenkinsfile.

3. Configure the pipeline job to connect to your Git repository (e.g., GitHub) where your Terraform project is hosted.

4. Customize the pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) to match your Terraform project structure and requirements.

5. Save the Jenkins pipeline job configuration and trigger a build to start the pipeline.

## Usage

1. Commit and push changes to your Terraform project's Git repository.

2. Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline to build, validate, and apply the Terraform changes.

3. Monitor the pipeline's progress and view build logs and reports in the Jenkins web interface.

4. Optionally, configure post-build actions, notifications, or integrations as needed.

## Cleanup

If you enabled the "Terraform Destroy (Cleanup)" stage in your pipeline, Jenkins can also destroy the Terraform resources after successful deployment, ensuring cleanup and cost control.
